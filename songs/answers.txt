1. Calculate the average energy, valence, and danceability of the listenerâ€™s top 100 songs using:
SELECT AVG(energy), AVG(valence), AVG(danceability) FROM songs;

2. Limitations:
2-1.Does not account for play count or frequency.
2-2.Ignores mood changes throughout the year.
2-3.Energy, valence, and danceability may not fully capture song significance.

3.Better Methods:
3-1.Use weighted averages based on play count.
3-2.Analyze changes over time (e.g., by month).
3-3.Include more song features like tempo or genre.
